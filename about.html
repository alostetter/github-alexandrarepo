            Hi! I am a recent graduate from UNC Chapel Hill and have obtained my BS in Statistics & Analytics with a minor in Data Science. In recent internships at Relias and Veradigm, I have become familiar with statistical analysis, predictive modeling, and data visualization in various contexts using tools like Python, R, Power BI, and Excel. I have also been exposed to several different integrated development environments (IDEs) including VSCode, IntelliJ, and RStudio. This summer, I’m actively building my skills in SQL with online coursework, focusing on querying, data manipulation, and working with large datasets.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am actively seeking full-time opportunities starting in the summer of 2025, where I can apply my technical expertise and analytical mindset to solve real-world problems. I’m especially passionate about building predictive models with machine learning, uncovering insights from complex datasets, and clearly communicating results to both technical and non-technical stakeholders. I'm excited to contribute to a collaborative, impact-driven team and continue growing in the field of data science and analytics.
