          <strong>Diabetes Risk Prediction Using Machine Learning</strong> – Collaborated on a project analyzing behavioral and demographic data from the CDC’s BRFSS dataset to assess diabetes risk. We employed K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, and Logistic Regression, addressing class imbalance and refining features through EDA. Our goal was to evaluate model performance in identifying at-risk individuals and propose scalable health interventions.

          <strong>NCAA Tournament Outcome Prediction</strong> – This paper explores factors that influence win percentage in NCAA Division I men’s basketball by examining both gameplay statistics and recruiting data from 2013 to 2021. It poses two main questions: which gameplay variables best predict win percentage and whether recruiting data can serve as a reliable predictor. Through data collection, feature engineering, and statistical modeling, the paper builds and evaluates multiple predictive models to address these questions.

        <em>Note:</em> I have worked on several additional data analysis projects during my internships that are not featured here due to the sensitive and proprietary nature of the data involved.
